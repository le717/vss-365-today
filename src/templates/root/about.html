  <h2>What is #vss365?</h2>
  <p><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://makingfiction.com/history-of-vss365/">Created</a> by <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"  href="https://theflashdogs.com/a-daily-dose-of-short-fiction/">FlashDogs</a> in 2016, #vss365 participants write a tweet-sized short story based on a daily word prompt. Originally planned to last one year, the prompts are now given out by a new host every month, each with their own unique style and word choices. The hosts were originally scheduled by <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/voimaoy">Voimaoy</a> until the start of 2020, when <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/ArthurUnkTweets">Arthur Unk</a> took over host scheduling.</p>

  <h3>Getting started</h3>
  <p>To get started with #vss365, all you need is a Twitter account. Once the prompt is posted, write a story that incorporates the prompt word or uses the prompt as thematic inspiration. Make sure you include the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23vss365">#vss365</a> hashtag and the prompt word as a hashtag so everyone can find it! That's all there is to it! If you are still wanting more information, Sal Page has written an <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="http://sal-cobbledtogether.blogspot.com/2018/12/vss365-january-and-acpitservices.html">excellent blog post</a> with further background and writing tips.</p>

  <h3>What if I don't have Twitter?</h3>
  <p>If you don't have a Twitter accout, that's perfectly ok! You don't <em>have</em> to use Twitter to participate. You can still write a story from the prompt, or even use the prompt as inspiration for or incorporation into something else!</p>

  <h3>What if I miss a day?</h3>
  <p>Don't worry about that! If you miss a day, you can skip that prompt, write multiple stories, or combine the words into one story! There are no hard-and-fast rules here. It's all about having fun writing with the prompt. ðŸ˜Š</p>

  <h3>What does vss365 even mean?</h3>
  <p>"vss365" stands for Very Short Story 365 days a year! The idea behind the hashtag is to give writers daily writing inspiration every day of the year, hence 365. Because the stories traditionally fit in a tweet, they were dubbed "very short", creating the vss part of vss365.</p>
