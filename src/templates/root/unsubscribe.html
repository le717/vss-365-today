  <p>It looks like you're wanting to unsubscribe from the daily #vss365 email notifications. We're sorry to see you go, but fully respect your decision. Stuff happens, and sometimes you gotta remove the clutter from your life (or inbox). ðŸ™‚</p>

  <p>Whatever your reason, just enter your registered email below and you will be removed from the notification list.</p>

  {% include "partials/form-unsubscribe.html" %}

  {% elif removal_success == true %}
  <p>You have been successfully removed from the notification list.<br>
    We hope you're still planning on participating in the #vss365 prompts!</p>

  {% elif removal_success == false %}
  <p>We're terribly sorry about this, but we were unable to remove your email from the notification list.<br>
    Please try to unsubscribe again in a few minutes.</p>
