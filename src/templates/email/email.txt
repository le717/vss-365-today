Hello #vss365 today subscriber!

It's been a while since I've sent y'all an update regarding the planned email infrastructure upgrades.
I ended up having to delay that project and switch my development priorities to sustain the maintainability and
stability of the site. A lot of cool things have happened in the last few months that I hope to write about on my blog soon. :D

However, with those pieces out of the way (and some reevaluation of my expectations versus reality), I have finally set up
the new email sending service and revised the site to send out a random portion of the existing mailing list
through the new service. To improve the chance it'll land in your inbox, you may consider adding noreply@mail.codetri.net
to your email contacts. I'll gradually be increasing the number of emails using the new service until it is fully used,
when I'll also open back up new subscriptions again (woo-hoo!).

Additionally, I've set up a small donate page if you'd like to invest in #vss365 today to help keep it online. You don't have to
donate to use the site or remain on the email list. #vss365 today is and will remain 100% free to use. I have simply set it up
for you to donate if you would like. Full details are available at https://vss365today.com/donate.

Finally, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for subscribing to #vss365 today! I am in debt to your support and enthusiasm to sharing this small project of mine with others. It brings me great joy to know that you are being blessed by my developing this site. Thank you so much for your continued support. I appreciate you personally very much. :)
